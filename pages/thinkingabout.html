    <p> thinking about : how everyone is a single point in the universe that constantly experiences things and that our interactions with others is just a culmination of the continuous experiences they have had in the context of the continuous experiences that we have had. we experience others as the point while simultaneously experiencing ourselves in the past, present, and future.  </p> </div>

  <div class="m">
    <p> <a href="https://www.merlinsheldrake.com/entangled-life"> <i> Entagled Life </i> </a> :  "[...]all life-forms are in fact <i>processes</i> not <i>things</i>. The "you" of five years ago was made from different stuff than the
"you" of today. Nature is an event that never stops. As William Bateson,
who coined the word <i>genetics</i>, observed, 'We commonly think of animals
and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is
continually passing.' When we see an organism, from a fungus to a pine
tree, we catch a single moment in its continual development." </p>

<p> thinking about : the universe holding everything until someone tries to describes it. when you describe something you consolidate infinite possible characteristics to a single point to form a concrete idea/item.  </p> </div>
