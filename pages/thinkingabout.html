    <p> thinking about : how everyone is a single point in the universe that constantly experiences things and that our interactions with others is just a cumulation of the continuous experiences they have had in the context of the continuous experiences that we have had. we experience others as the point while simultaneously experiencing ourselves in the past, present, and future.  </p> </div>
    <div></div>

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : the dissonance between the present self and future self, e.g., what do i want to do now that my future self will have to deal with.  </p> </div>
<div></div>

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about :  how i am unable to visualize things in my minds eye but i am able to have very vivid dreams. wondering if there is a way to practice this use of the brain while being awake to help consciously visualize things. </p> </div>

<!-- <div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about :  the universe holding everything until someone tries to describes it. when you describe something you consolidate infinite possible characteristics to a single point to form a concrete item.  </p> </div>
