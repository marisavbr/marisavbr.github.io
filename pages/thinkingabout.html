    <h1> thinking about </h1>

    <div class="wrap">
* * *
    <p> thinking about : how everyone is a single point in the universe that constantly experiences things and that our interactions with others is just a culmination of the continuous experiences they have had in the context of the continuous experiences that we have had. we experience others as the point while simultaneously experiencing ourselves in the past, present, and future.  </p> </div>
    <div></div>

  <div class="m">
    <p> <a href="https://www.merlinsheldrake.com/entangled-life" target="_blank"> <i> Entagled Life </i> </a> :
 "[...]all life-forms are in fact <i>processes</i> not <i>things</i>.
 The "you" of five years ago was made from different stuff than the
"you" of today. Nature is an event that never stops. As William Bateson,
who coined the word <i>genetics</i>, observed, 'We commonly think of animals
and plants as matter, but they are really systems through which matter is
continually passing.' When we see an organism, from a fungus to a pine
tree, we catch a single moment in its continual development." </p>

</div></div>

<div class="wrap">
  <p> thinking about : why are humans obsessed with documentation - events, the passing of time, art, etc,. </p>
</div>
  <div></div>

  <div class="m">
    <p> - it is almost as if we are "archeologists" for our selves. we document what is happening now and this will later be artifacts to ourselves in the future.</p>
  <p>  - however, "a reliance on artifacts will thus bias an account of ancient hunter-gatherer life"<a href="https://www.vromansbookstore.com/book/9780062316110">*</a>... or "ancient" events of our own life &rArr; in the
    future you will not see what you did not choose to document. if you rely too heavily on these artifacts you will have a skewed perception of the past (do not fully rely on this. you cannot document everything nor should you try to).</p>
<div class="m">
    <p>- think about this when you are documenting or actively not documenting things. ask your self why this might or might not be important for you to have in the future or how might it add to a better self understanding. </p>
</div>
</div> </div>
* * *

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : the dissonance between the present self and future self, e.g., what do i want to do now that my future self will have to deal with.  </p> </div>
<div></div>
* * *

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : how i am unable to visualize things in my minds eye but i am able to have very vivid dreams. wondering if there is a way to practice this use of the brain while being awake to help consciously visualize things. </p> </div>
<div></div>
* * *

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : how i hissed at my cat to keep her from running out the door when i got home. </p> </div>

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : the aquatic worm that absorbs its brain when it finds a spot to anchor for the duration of its life. </p> </div>

<div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : learning happens through failure. </p> </div>
<div></div>

<!-- <div class="wrap">

<p> thinking about : the universe holding everything until someone tries to describes it. when you describe something you consolidate infinite possible characteristics to a single point to form a concrete idea/item.  </p> </div>
