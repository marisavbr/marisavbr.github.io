my favorites : <i> Mostly Here, Ram, Cheeto Lust </i>

<p>
I have listened to this EP so much since I found it (02-25-2021). I basically have it on repeat.
More specifically, I ~religiously~ listen to <i> Mostly Here</i>. The sounds of the vocals stimulate
such a strong physiological response in me that it makes me cry (this is especially heightened if I am
attempting to sing it). There is an alternate version of this song on the album
<a href="https://greatgrandpa.bandcamp.com/track/mostly-here-3"> <i> Four of Arrows </i></a>.
<i> Can Opener </i> is one of the few collections of songs that I can listen through without wanting
to skip anything.

my favorites : <i> Homeland, Falling, By & By, Light Show, Creatures, Sloth </i>

<p>
<i> Hinge </i> holds a consistent atmosphere through out the entirety of the album. With the help of this
consistency, E B U was able to create a cohesive sounding album while picking varying styles of sounds to
experiement with. This album ranges from having songs filled with doodles of sound to songs that are more
oriented towards quirky vocals/rhythms. <i> Homeland </i> shares similar characteristics to songs used through
out the show <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/library/Kaiba_(Library)"> Kaiba </a>. Additionally, this
song could have been a good last song as I felt it would have wrapped up the album nicely. Tagged as swamppop
on bandcamp.
