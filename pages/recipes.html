<p> I referenced these two recipes to make the curry chicken. I was very happy with the outcome of combining
the recipes. I would like to try it with coconut milk/cream as a way to make it a bit more rich. Overall,
I was satisfied with the meal and will be making this again in the near future.</p>
<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p>1. Cut chicken into bite-sized bits (~1 lb) + toss in soy sauce and corn starch mixture. </p>
<p>2. Cook the chicken in wok. Once chicken is cooked, remove from wok. </p>
<p>3. Add more oil + cook veggies (1/2 an onion, 2 carrots, 1/2 a bell pepper, 1 jalape&ntilde;o). </p>
<p>4. Add ~1/4 cup chicken stock. Let it cook down (do this to keep the veggies from sticking to the pan). </p>
<p>5. Add more chicken stock (1 cup). </p>
<p>6. Add spices + *brown sugar* (I ended up doubling the spices from <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-curry-takeout/"> thewoksoflife.com </a>). </p>
<p>7. Let the chicken stock cook down a bit, and then add corn starch slurry to thicken sauce.
  (I added two slurries to get desired thickness; 1 teaspoon corn starch : 2 teaspoons water and another 1:1). </p>
<p> 8. Add the chicken back to the wok and let simmer in sauce for a few minutes.</p>
9. Serve with rice!

<p> I tried making this recipe one time with out altering the ingredients I didn't like it.
It was extremely salty and really liquidy. Here are some alterations to the recipe!

  <p>  &#8226; 1 jalape&ntilde;o </p>

  <p>  &#8226; 1/4 cup and another heaping spoon of peanut butter </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1 tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1/2 cup of regular chicken stock </p>
  <p>  &#8226; ~1/8th cup of oyster sauce </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 4 tbsp of garlic chili paste </p>
  <p>  &#8226; a squirt or two of honey</p>
  <p>  &#8226; sesame seeds to your liking </p>

<p> Super rich and creamy. Added extra tea for a stronger flavor. Very difficult to eat a whole bowl of it
  because it is so rich. The sweetness gave me a headache before I was able to finish it. Boba went well
  with it, however, I would have prefered thai iced tea + boba.

ideal experience : having a whole bowl

realistic experience : having a couple spoonsful
