<p> Very pleased with these savory scones. I did not put bacon in them because I used it all when making the quiche! I ended up replacing the heavy cream with
   butter + milk becuase I didnt want them to be as cakey. I used preshredded cheddar cheese but I reccomend getting a block of cheese and preparing it yourself
   so you can have better control over the size of the grate or cubes. Next time, I will add more cheese and green onions if I do not use bacon.</p>

<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p> 1. Instead of using 3/4 up of heavy cream/whipping cream I made a mixture of 6 tbsp of butter + 6 tbsp of milk for a more tender crumb. I used
<a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2019/03/19/cream-scones-vs-butter-scones">  Cream Scones vs. Butter Scones</a> as a reference for this substitution. Make sure the mixture
is cool before adding it to the flour! </p>
<p> 2. I used about 1 tbsp more milk to get the dough to stick together better after the initial incorporation of the 3/4 cup of butter + milk mixture.</p>
<p> 3. Brushed the scones with milk instead of cream prior to baking.</p>
 4. Baked for about 23 minutes.

  <p> I was very happy with how this turned out! I am very excited to have the leftovers for breakfast. My one regret was not par-baking the
  pie dough for longer after I removed the pie weights. The bottom of the crust was still pretty soggy/doughy (Paul Hollywood would have been ashamed).
  I think another 4-5 minutes added to the par-bake would have resulted in a better crust. Overall, the recipe was very good and I did not make
  very many changes to it.</p>
<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p> 1. I used about two times as much green onion than what was called for in the recipe. </p>
<p> 2. Replaced the ham with turkey bacon. I cooked this prior to baking it in the quiche.</p>
<p> 3. I cut back on the salt and only used ~1/2 a teaspoon.
<p> 3. Par-bake the pie dough before adding the egg mixture to avoid soggy crust. Instructions : <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-blind-bake-pie-crust/"> How to Par-Bake Pie Crust</a>. </p>

<p> I referenced these two recipes to make the curry chicken. I was very happy with the outcome of combining
the recipes. I would like to try it with coconut milk/cream as a way to make it a bit more rich. Overall,
I was satisfied with the meal and will be making this again in the near future. Update : adding coconut milk
makes this more rich and velvety, and adds only slight hints of coconut to the over all flavor. I usually add
around 1/4 - 1/2 of a cup of coconut milk. </p>

<!-- <p> photo : <a href="../resources/curry_chicken.jpg"> Curry Chicken </a> </p> -->

<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p>1. Cut chicken into bite-sized bits (~1 lb) + toss in soy sauce and corn starch mixture. </p>
<p>2. Cook the chicken in wok. Once chicken is cooked, remove from wok. </p>
<p>3. Add more oil + cook veggies (1/2 an onion, 2 carrots, 1/2 a bell pepper, 1 jalape&ntilde;o). </p>
<p>4. Add ~1/4 cup chicken stock. Let it cook down (do this prevent the veggies from sticking to the pan). </p>
<p>5. Add more chicken stock (1 cup). </p>
<p>6. Add spices + *brown sugar* (from <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-curry-takeout/"> thewoksoflife.com</a>). </p>
<p>7. Let the chicken stock cook down a bit, and then add corn starch slurry to thicken sauce.
  (I added two slurries to get desired thickness; 1 teaspoon corn starch : 2 teaspoons water and another 1:1). </p>
<p>8. Add coconut milk + more spices (if desired).
<p>9. Add the chicken back to the wok and let simmer in sauce for a few minutes.</p>
<p>10. Serve with rice!</p>

<div class="wrap">

<p> I really loved this recipe! It reminded me of when my mom would make
  albondigas soup when I was little. I reccomend making this on a cold/rainy
  day to get all around cozy vibes. Another good thing about this recipe is
  that is it pretty inexpensive and it makes A LOT of food (~4.5 servings).
  I wish the recipe included jalape&ntilde;os, however, this is very easy to
  incorperate without directions.
   </p>

<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p> 1. Substituted the spearmint and parsley in the broth and the oregano in the
  meatballs for fresh cilantro. </p>
<p> 2. Thoroughly chop ~1 cup of cilantro for the meatballs for better incorporation. </p>
<p> 3. For the veggies I used carrots, celery, and zucchini. </p>
<p> 4. I also substituted the ground beef for ground turkey. </p>
<p> 5. Added a few cloves of garlic + some milk to the meatballs. </p>
<p> 6. Used equal parts chicken stock to water (1.5 : 1.5 quarts). </p>
<p> 7. Added cilantro to the broth ~5 minutes before serving.</p>
<p> 8. Added red pepper flakes to the broth. </p>

<p> I tried making this recipe one time with out altering the ingredients I didn't like it.
It was extremely salty and really liquidy. Here are some alterations to the recipe!
</p>
<h4> Notes : </h4>
  <p>  &#8226; 3-4 cloves of garlic (or as many as you want)</p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1 jalape&ntilde;o </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1 tablespoon of sesame oil </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1/4 cup and another heaping spoon of peanut butter </p>

  <p>  &#8226; 1/2 cup of regular chicken stock </p>
  <p>  &#8226; ~1/8th cup of oyster sauce </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 4 tbsp of garlic chili paste </p>

<p> At first I was slightly disappointed with how this came out but I later realized that it was
  because they had not cooled down all the way when I ate them. These are VERY good and
  refreshing when they are cold. I reccomdend keeping them in the fridge. Only dust individual
  pieces you are eating in powdered sugar otherwise it will melt on the the top of all the lemon bars.
  My main issue with the recipe is that it does not provide a precise measurment for the amount of
  lemon juice needed. I halved the recipe but still ended up using what I think to be the full amount
  of lemon juice that the recipe called for (originally very sweet).</p>

  <h4>  Notes : </h4>
  <p> 1. Cook the crust until it is lightly golden (I had to add more time). </p>
  <p> 2. Add more lemon juice if you want a more tangy lemon bar.</p>
  <p> 3. If you added more juice, add a couple more spoonsful of flour to it.</p>
      4. If using unsalted butter, add a little salt to the crust.

<p> Super rich and creamy. Added extra tea for a stronger flavor. Very difficult to eat a whole bowl of it
  because it is so rich. The sweetness gave me a headache before I was able to finish it. Boba went well
  with it, however, I would have prefered to just have thai iced tea + boba.

  <p> The recipe in the link provided was a helpful and basic recipe. This allowed
me to make alterations to the recipe as I saw fit. I followed the instructions
provided in this recipe (with the exception of the ice bath). I just changed the
ingredients a little bit. I used half as many strawberries because I did not want
that much syrup. Tasted like a fresh flavored milk -- dont expect nesquik! I
would like to try this again with malt.</p>

  <h4>  Notes : </h4>
  <p> 1. 1 1/2 cups strawberries; stemmed and chopped </p>
  <p> 2. 2 tbsp granulated sugar </p>
  <p> 3. ~1 tsp vanilla extract </p>
  <p> 4. Pour the syrup in a bowl.</p>
  <p> 5. Fill a larger bowl with chilled water.</p>
  <p> 6. Place the syrup filled bowl into the water to cool (ice bath).</p>
  <p> 7. Blend once cooled. </p>
