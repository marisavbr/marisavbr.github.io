  <p> I was very happy with how this turned out! I am very excited to have the leftovers for breakfast. My one regret was not par-baking the
  pie dough for longer after I removed the pie weights. The bottom of the crust was still pretty soggy/doughy (Paul Hollywood would have been ashamed).
  I think another 4-5 minutes added to the par-bake would have resulted in a better crust. Overall, the recipe was very good and I did not make
  very many changes to it.</p>
<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p> 1. I used about two times as much green onion than what was called for in the recipe. </p>
<p> 2. Replaced the ham with turkey bacon. I cooked this prior to baking it in the quiche.</p>
<p> 3. I cut back on the salt and only used ~1/2 a teaspoon.
<p> 3. Par-bake the pie dough before adding the egg mixture to avoid soggy crust. Instructions : <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/how-to-blind-bake-pie-crust/"> How to Par-Bake Pie Crust</a>. </p>

<p> I referenced these two recipes to make the curry chicken. I was very happy with the outcome of combining
the recipes. I would like to try it with coconut milk/cream as a way to make it a bit more rich. Overall,
I was satisfied with the meal and will be making this again in the near future. Update : adding coconut milk
makes this more rich and velvety, and adds only slight hints of coconut to the over all flavor. I usually add
around 1/4 - 1/2 of a cup of coconut milk. </p>

<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p>1. Cut chicken into bite-sized bits (~1 lb) + toss in soy sauce and corn starch mixture. </p>
<p>2. Cook the chicken in wok. Once chicken is cooked, remove from wok. </p>
<p>3. Add more oil + cook veggies (1/2 an onion, 2 carrots, 1/2 a bell pepper, 1 jalape&ntilde;o). </p>
<p>4. Add ~1/4 cup chicken stock. Let it cook down (do this prevent the veggies from sticking to the pan). </p>
<p>5. Add more chicken stock (1 cup). </p>
<p>6. Add spices + *brown sugar* (from <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/chicken-curry-takeout/"> thewoksoflife.com</a>). </p>
<p>7. Let the chicken stock cook down a bit, and then add corn starch slurry to thicken sauce.
  (I added two slurries to get desired thickness; 1 teaspoon corn starch : 2 teaspoons water and another 1:1). </p>
<p>8. Add coconut milk (if desired).
<p>9. Add the chicken back to the wok and let simmer in sauce for a few minutes.</p>
<p> 10. Serve with rice!</p>

<div class="wrap">

<p> I really loved this recipe! It reminded me of when my mom would make
  albondigas soup when I was little. I reccomend making this on a cold/rainy
  day to get all around cozy vibes. Another good thing about this recipe is
  that is it pretty inexpensive and it makes A LOT of food (~4.5 servings).
  I wish the recipe included jalape&ntilde;os, however, this is very easy to
  incorperate without directions.
   </p>

<h4> Notes : </h4>
<p> 1. Substituted spearmint, parsley, and oregano for fresh cilantro.</p>
<p> 2. For the veggies I used carrots, celery, and zucchini. </p>
<p> 3. I also substituted the ground beef for ground turkey and used chicken stock. </p>
<p> 4. Added a few cloves of garlic + some milk to the meatballs. </p>
<p> 5. Used equal parts chicken stock to water (1.5 : 1.5 quarts). </p>
<p> 6. Added cilantro to the pot of soup ~5 minutes before serving.</p>
<p> 7. Added red pepper flakes to the broth. </p>

<p> I tried making this recipe one time with out altering the ingredients I didn't like it.
It was extremely salty and really liquidy. Here are some alterations to the recipe!
</p>

  <p>  &#8226; 1 jalape&ntilde;o </p>

  <p>  &#8226; 1/4 cup and another heaping spoon of peanut butter </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1 tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 1/2 cup of regular chicken stock </p>
  <p>  &#8226; ~1/8th cup of oyster sauce </p>
  <p>  &#8226; 4 tbsp of garlic chili paste </p>
  <p>  &#8226; a squirt or two of honey</p>
  <p>  &#8226; sesame seeds to your liking </p>
  <p>  &#8226; red pepper flakes to your liking </p>

<p> Super rich and creamy. Added extra tea for a stronger flavor. Very difficult to eat a whole bowl of it
  because it is so rich. The sweetness gave me a headache before I was able to finish it. Boba went well
  with it, however, I would have prefered to just have thai iced tea + boba.

  <p> The recipe in the link provided was a helpful and basic recipe. This allowed
me to make alterations to the recipe as I saw fit. I followed the instructions
provided in this recipe (with the exception of the ice bath). I just changed the
ingredients a little bit. I used half as many strawberries because I did not want
that much syrup. Tasted like a fresh flavored milk -- dont expect nesquik! I
would like to try this again with malt.</p>

  <h4>  Notes : </h4>
  <p> 1. 1 1/2 cups strawberries; stemmed and chopped </p>
  <p> 2. 2 tbsp granulated sugar </p>
  <p> 3. ~1 tsp vanilla extract </p>
  <p> 4. Pour the syrup in a bowl.</p>
  <p> 5. Fill a larger bowl with chilled water.</p>
  <p> 6. Place the syrup filled bowl into the water to cool (ice bath).</p>
  <p> 7. Blend. </p>
