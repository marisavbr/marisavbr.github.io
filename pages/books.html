*working on review*

<!-- A book about the fungus among us. I enjoyed the experience of reading this book while simultaneously
learning about and practicing the cultivation of mushrooms. These different paths of learning has helped
me gain a more holistic idea of the history and future of the fungi kingdom. Much like us, fungi are a very
complex species. Often, it is difficult to determine where one organism stops and another one beings. This
reality has forced me to reflect on what it means to truly be an "individual". -->
